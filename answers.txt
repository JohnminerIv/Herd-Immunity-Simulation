1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate,  reproductive rate)
Name="Tuberculosis" repro_rate=0.67 mortality_rate=0.55 pop_size=10000 persent_vaccinated=0.95 initial_infected=10
"Tuberculosis" 0.67 0.55 10000 0.95 10
1. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
0.048 percent became infected before the virus burned out.
1.  What percentage of the population died from the virus?
0.0276 percent of the whole population died
